Automatic Instance-edge Detection Network (AID-Net) - Vertebral Edge Detection by Deep Learning	Conference Presentation	AID-Net	European Society for Clinical Investigation(ESCI) Congress	2019-05	Coimbra, Portugal	A novel deep learning-based vertebral edge detection method was proposed to automize the part of routine clinical work. 
Fast Similarity Measure of SWATH-MS by Cosine Similarity of Random Pairs(CS-RP)	Conference Presentation	CS-RP	Asia Oceania Mass Spectrometry Conference (AOMSC) 2017	2017-12-13	Biopolis, Singapore		We proposed a new similarity measure on MS2 (tandem mass spectrometry) data - cosine similarity of random pairs(CS-RP). This method reduces time cost of intensity-wise retention time alignment by SWATH or other DIA-MS2 data. The results of CS-RP shared similar results from the retention time alignments with MS1-based method.
