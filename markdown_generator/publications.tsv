2022-01-15	Integrating multimodal data through interpretable heterogeneous ensembles	bioRxiv	Ensemble Integration (EI) was proposed as a novel late integration to multimodal data to predict biomedical characteristics, such as protein functions and disease outcomes. It infers local models and integrates them by heterogeneous ensemble algorithms.

2021-10-05	Machine learning–driven identification of early-life air toxic combinations associated with childhood asthma outcomes	The Journal of Clinical Investigation	Air pollution is a well-known contributor to asthma. Air toxics are hazardous air pollutants that cause or may cause serious health effects. Although individual air toxics have been associated with asthma, only a limited number of studies have specifically examined combinations of air toxics associated with the disease.
