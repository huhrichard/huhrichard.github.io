*Richard Li* received Dean of Engineering Scholarship, when he was admitted to [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2013.
He received his in [B.Eng. in Computer Engineering](http://cpeg.ust.hk/cgi-bin/eng/index.php) in 2017 and [M.Phil. in Bioengineering](https://bien.ust.hk/) in 2019, both are from [HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/).
His undergraduate study combined Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Electronic Engineering. He joined [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP)](https://urop.ust.hk/) under supervision of Prof. [Henry H. N. Lam](http://kehlam.people.ust.hk/index.html) in 2017 Summer. His master thesis project was building an automatic vertebral edge detection method via Deep Learning under supervision of [Prof. Richard H.Y. So](https://www.ielm.ust.hk/dfaculty/so/).

Currently, he works as a Bioinformatician in [Pandey's Lab](https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/pandeylab/), [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/)
exploring and analyzing biomedical data by machine learning techniques.
Various machine learning techniques from conventional to modern deep learning are applied for different data and different purposes.
