*Richard Yan-Chak Li*, a Hong Kong native received Dean of Engineering Scholarship, when he was admitted to [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2013.
He received his in [B.Eng. in Computer Engineering](http://cpeg.ust.hk/cgi-bin/eng/index.php) in 2017 and [M.Phil. in Bioengineering](https://bien.ust.hk/) in 2019, both are from [HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/).
His undergraduate study combined Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Electronic Engineering. He joined [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP)](https://urop.ust.hk/) under supervision of Prof. [Henry H. N. Lam](http://kehlam.people.ust.hk/index.html) in 2017 Summer. His master thesis project was building an automatic vertebral edge detection method via Deep Learning under supervision of [Prof. Richard H.Y. So](https://www.ielm.ust.hk/dfaculty/so/).

Currently, he works as a Bioinformatician in [Pandey's Lab](https://gpandeylab.org/), [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/) exploring and analyzing biomedical data by machine learning techniques. Various machine learning techniques from conventional to modern are applied for different biomedical data, eg. discovering combination of air pollutant leading to childhood asthmatic outcomes, protein function predictions by multimodal data, etc.
