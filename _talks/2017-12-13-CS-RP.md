We proposed a new similarity measure on MS2 (tandem mass spectrometry) data - cosine similarity of random pairs(CS-RP). This method reduces time cost of intensity-wise retention time alignment by SWATH or other DIA-MS2 data. The results of CS-RP shared similar results from the retention time alignments with MS1-based method.
